# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

# config_schema:
#  - ["my_app", "o", {title: "My app custom settings"}]
#  - ["my_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
#  - ["my_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
#  - ["my_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", get_cfg()->device.id);
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/sys_config.c or build/gen/sys_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
config_schema:
  - ["aws.thing_name", "stranger-things"]
  - ["device.id", "stranger-things"]
#  - ["mqtt.enable", true]
#  - ["mqtt.server", "a2c1l1gbq4iltk.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:8883"]
#  - ["mqtt.clean_session", true]
#  - ["mqtt.keep_alive", 60]
#  - ["mqtt.reconnect_timeout_max", 60.0000]
#  - ["mqtt.reconnect_timeout_min", 2.0000]
#  - ["mqtt.ssl_ca_cert", "ca.pem"]
#  - ["mqtt.ssl_cert", "6c520e95b4-certificate.pem.crt"]
#  - ["mqtt.ssl_key", "6c520e95b4-private.pem.key"]
  - ["wifi.ap.enable", false ]
  - ["wifi.sta.enable", true ]
